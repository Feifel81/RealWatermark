# RealWatermark

This with AI generated Programm converts PDF files into Pictures and Back to PDF to make a Real 1 Layer PDF with the Watermark.

The App can work with many PDF-files and converts all PDF-Files in a Folder including the subfolders and saves the files in the same folder structure in a defined output folder which has to be created.

The files in the output folder have the same subfolders with the pdf files in it. 

The filenames of the new pdf-files are the same so be careful that you dont select the input folder!!
